# Query-as-a-Service

## Overview

A powerful ORM with built-in access control enables a wide range of possibilities. The most exciting one is to serve a set of data query web APIs automatically derived from your data model.

Automatically serving data query APIs is not a new idea. Many Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platforms, such as Hasura, Firebase and, Supabase, provide such features. However, ZenStack takes a different approach by providing a set of server adapters that you can plug into your application. You can enjoy the convenience of the query service while still having complete control over your choice of framework and hosting environment.

Understanding the query service involves two main concepts: [API Handler](./api-handler) and [Server Adapter](./server-adapter.md).
