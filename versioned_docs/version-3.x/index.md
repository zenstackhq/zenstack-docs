# Welcome

Welcome to ZenStack - the data layer for modern TypeScript applications.

ZenStack is built with the belief that most applications should use the data model as their center pillar. If that model is well-designed, it can serve as the single source of truth throughout the app's lifecycle and be used to derive many other aspects of the app. The result is a smaller, more cohesive code base that scales well as your team grows while maintaining a high level of developer experience.

Inside the package you'll find:

- **Intuitive schema language**
  
  That helps you model data, relations, access control, and more, in one place. [ðŸ”—](./modeling/)

- **Powerful ORM**
  
  With awesomely-typed API, built-in access control, and unmatched flexibility. [ðŸ”—](./orm/)

- **Query-as-a-Service**
  
  That provides a full-fledged data API without the need to code it up. [ðŸ”—](./service/)

- **Utilities**
  
  For deriving artifacts like Zod schemas, frontend hooks, OpenAPI specs, etc., from the schema. [ðŸ”—](./category/utilities)

ZenStack originated as an extension to Prisma ORM. V3 is a complete rewrite that removed Prisma as a runtime dependency and replaced it with an implementation built from scratch ("scratch" = [Kysely](https://kysely.dev/) ðŸ˜†). On its surface, it continues to use a "Prisma-superset" schema language and a query API compatible with PrismaClient. [This blog post](https://zenstack.dev/blog/next-chapter-1) contains more background about the thoughts behind the v3 refactor.
