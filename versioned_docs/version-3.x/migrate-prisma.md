# Migrating From Prisma

## Overview

This guide will help you migrate an existing Prisma project to ZenStack v3. The process is made straightforward by the following design decisions:

1. The ZModel schema language is a superset of Prisma Schema Language.
2. The ORM provides a Prisma-compatible API.
3. The migration engine is built on top of Prisma Migrate.

In the following sections, we'll cover various aspects of the migration process where care needs to be taken.

ZenStack v3 currently only supports PostgreSQL and SQLite databases.

## Migration Steps

### 1. Project dependencies

ZenStack v3 doesn't depend on Prisma at runtime. Its CLI has a peer dependency on the `prisma` package for migration related commands. The most straightforward way is to follow these steps:

- Remove `prisma` and `@prisma/client` from your project dependencies.
- Install ZenStack packages
    
    <PackageInstall dependencies={['@zenstackhq/runtime@next']} devDependencies={['@zenstackhq/cli@next']} />

- Install a database driver
  
    ZenStack doesn't bundle database drivers. Install the appropriate driver for your database:

    <Tabs>
    <TabItem value="postgres" label="PostgreSQL">

    <PackageInstall dependencies={['pg']} devDependencies={['@types/pg']} />

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="sqlite" label="SQLite">

    <PackageInstall dependencies={['better-sqlite3']} devDependencies={['@types/better-sqlite3']} />

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>


You don't need to explicitly install `prisma` package because the `@zenstackhq/cli` has a peer dependency on it.

### 2. Migrate your schema

If you have a single `schema.prisma` file, you can move and rename it to `zenstack/schema.zmodel`. No change should be necessary because every valid Prisma schema is also a valid ZModel schema. The only optional change you can consider making is to remove the Prisma client generator block since it doesn't have any effect in ZenStack:

```zmodel
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}
```

If you use Prisma's [multi-schema feature](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema/overview/location#multi-file-prisma-schema), you'll need to explicitly use the `import` statement to merge related schema files into a whole graph. See [Multi-file Schema](./modeling/multi-file.md) for details.

### 3. Update generation command

In your `package.json` scripts, replace the `prisma generate` command with `zen generate`.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "generate": "zen generate"
  }
}
```

### 4. Update database client instantiation

Replace `new PrismaClient()` with `new ZenStackClient(schema, ...)` where `schema` is imported from the TypeScript code generated by the `zen generate` command.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="postgres" label={`PostgreSQL`}>

```ts title='db.ts'
import { ZenStackClient } from '@zenstackhq/runtime';
import { schema } from './zenstack/schema';
import { PostgresDialect } from 'kysely';
import { Pool } from 'pg';

export const db = new ZenStackClient(schema, {
  dialect: new PostgresDialect({
    pool: new Pool({
      connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
    }),
  }),
});
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="sqlite" label={`SQLite`}>

```ts title='db.ts'
import { ZenStackClient } from '@zenstackhq/runtime';
import { SqliteDialect } from 'kysely';
import SQLite from 'better-sqlite3';
import { schema } from './zenstack/schema';

export const db = new ZenStackClient(schema, {
  dialect: new SqliteDialect({
    database: new SQLite('./db.sqlite'),
  }),
});
```
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Since `ZenStackClient` has a PrismaClient-compatible API, you should not need to change your existing code that uses the database client.

### 5. Update type references

Prisma generates many TypeScript types that you may have used in your code, such as `User`, `UserCreateArgs`, etc. ZenStack replicates some of the most useful types in its generated code.

For top-level model types like `User`, you can import from the `models.ts` file. For other detailed input types like `UserCreateArgs`, import them from the `input.ts` file.

### 6. Update migration command

In your `package.json` scripts, replace the Prisma `db` and `migrate` commands with ZenStack equivalents:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "db:push": "zen db push",
    "migrate:dev": "zen migrate dev",
    "migrate:deploy": "zen migrate deploy"
  }
}
```

## Other Considerations

Now, let's check the areas that are less straightforward to migrate.

### Prisma custom generators

ZenStack has its own CLI plugin system and doesn't support Prisma custom generators. However, you can continue running them with the following two steps:

1. Use the [@core/prisma](./reference/plugins/prisma.md) plugin to generate a Prisma schema from ZModel.
   
    ```zmodel
    plugin prisma {
      provider = '@core/prisma'
      output = './schema.prisma'
    }
    ```

2. Run a `prisma generate` command after `zen generate` with the prisma schema as input.
   
   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "generate": "zen generate && prisma generate --schema=zenstack/schema.prisma"
     }
   }
   ```

### Prisma client extensions

ZenStack has its own [runtime plugin mechanism](./orm/plugins/) and doesn't plan to be compatible with Prisma client extensions. However, there are easy migration paths for the two most popular types of Prisma client extensions.

**1. Query extension**

[Query extension](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/client-extensions/query) allows you to intercept ORM query calls.

Suppose you have an extension like:

```ts
const extPrisma = prisma.$extends({
  query: {
    user: {
      async findMany({ model, operation, args, query }) {
        // take incoming `where` and set `age`
        args.where = { ...args.where, age: { gt: 18 } }
        return query(args)
      },
    },
  },
});
```

You can replace it with an equivalent ZenStack plugin:

```ts
const extDb = db.$use({
  id: 'my-plugin',
  onQuery: {
    user: {
      async findMany({ model, operation, args, proceed }) {
        // take incoming `where` and set `age`
        args.where = { ...args.where, age: { gt: 18 } }
        return proceed(args)
      },
    },
  },
});
```

You can also use the special `$allModels` and `$allOperations` keys to apply the plugin to all models and operations, like when using Prisma client extensions.

**2. Result extension**

[Result extension](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/client-extensions/result) allows you to add custom fields to query results. ZenStack provides a mechanism that achieves the same goal but a lot more powerful.

Suppose you have a result extension like:

```ts
const extPrisma = prisma.$extends({
  result: {
    user: {
      fullName: {
        // the dependencies
        needs: { firstName: true, lastName: true },
        compute(user) {
          // the computation logic
          return `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

You can replace it with a ZenStack computed field, which involves changes in ZModel and database client instantiation.

```zmodel title="zenstack/schema.zmodel"
model User {
  ...
  firstName String
  lastName  String
  fullName  String  @computed
}
```

```ts
export const db = new ZenStackClient(schema, {
  ...,
  computedFields: {
    User: {
      // SQL: CONCAT(firstName, ' ', lastName)
      fullName: (eb) => eb.fn('concat', ['firstName', eb.val(' '), 'lastName'])
    },
  },
});
```

A key difference is that ZenStack's computed fields are evaluated on the database side, which much more efficient and flexible than client-side computation. Read more in the [Computed Fields](./orm/computed-fields.md) documentation.
