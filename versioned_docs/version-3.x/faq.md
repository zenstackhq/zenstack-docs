# 🙋🏻 FAQ

## What databases are supported?

Currently only SQLite (with [better-sqlite3](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3) or [sql.js](https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js) driver) and PostgreSQL (with [node-postgres](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres) driver) are supported. MySQL will be added in the future. There's no plan to support other relational databases or NoSQL databases.
