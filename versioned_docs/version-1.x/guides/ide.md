## JetBrains IDEs

ZenStack provides a plugin for JetBrains IDEs. The extension is based on JetBrain platform's new [Language Server Protocol (LSP) support](https://blog.jetbrains.com/platform/2023/07/lsp-for-plugin-developers/). The extension only offers preliminary features today, but please expect improvements in the future as the LSP support matures.

:::info
JetBrain's LSP support is not available to the community edition of the IDEs, so is the ZenStack plugin.
