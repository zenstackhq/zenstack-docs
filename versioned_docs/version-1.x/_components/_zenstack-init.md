The "init" command does the following things for you:

1. Install Prisma if it's not already installed.
2. Install the `zenstack` CLI package as a dev dependency.
3. Install the `@zenstackhq/runtime` package - used for enhancing `PrismaClient` at the runtime.
4. Copy the `prisma/schema.prisma` file to `schema.zmodel` if it exists; otherwise, create a new template `schema.zmodel` file.

You can always manually complete the steps above if you have a special project setup that the "init" command doesn't work with.

After the initialization, please remember that you should edit the `schema.zmodel` moving forward. The `prisma/schema.prisma` file will be automatically regenerated when you run `zenstack generate`.
