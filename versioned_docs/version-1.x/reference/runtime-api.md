# Runtime API Reference

This document provides references for runtime APIs exported from the `@zenstackhq/runtime` package.

## Prisma Enhancement API

Enhancement APIs create wrappers around a Prisma client to add additional behavior. These wrappers can be freely combined to fine-tune what behavior to include.

### enhance

#### Description

Calling `enhance` is the simplest way to include all essential enhancements offered by ZenStack, including access policies, field validation, field omission, and password hashing. It's equivalent to calling:

```ts
withOmit(withPassword(withPolicy(prisma, options)));
```

#### Signature

```ts
function enhance<DbClient extends object>(
    prisma: DbClient,
    context?: WithPolicyContext,
    options?: EnhancementOptions
): DbClient;
```

##### Parameter `prisma`

The PrismaClient instance to enhance.

##### Parameter `context`

The context to for evaluating access policies with the following typing.

```ts
type WithPolicyContext = {
    user?: Record<string, unknown>
};
```

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| user  | The user object that provides value for the `auth()` function call in access policies. If provided. Its shape should be consistent with the `User` model in your ZModel, with all fields optional except for id field(s). Pass `undefined` to represent an anonymous user, and the `auth()` function call will evaluate to `null` in that case. |

##### Parameter `options`

Options with the following typing.

```ts
type TransactionIsolationLevel =
    | 'ReadUncommitted'
    | 'ReadCommitted'
    | 'RepeatableRead'
    | 'Snapshot'
    | 'Serializable';

type EnhancementOptions = {
    loadPath?: string;
    policy?: PolicyDef;
    modelMeta?: ModelMeta;
    logPrismaQuery?: boolean;
    transactionMaxWait?: number;
    transactionTimeout?: number;
    transactionIsolationLevel?: TransactionIsolationLevel;
};
```

| logPrismaQuery | Whether to log queries sent to Prisma client. Log will be emitted with "info" level, so please make sure you [turn that level on](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/working-with-prismaclient/logging#log-to-stdout) when creating Prisma client | false                        |
| transactionMaxWait        | The `maxWait` option (in ms) passed to `prisma.$transaction()` call for transactions initiated by ZenStack. |       100000                  |
| transactionTimeout        | The `timeout` option (in ms) passed to `prisma.$transaction()` call for transactions initiated by ZenStack. |       100000                  |

#### Example

```ts
const session = getSession();
const enhancedClient = enhance(prisma, { user: session.user });
```

### withPresets

#### Description

:::warning
This API is equivalent to [`enhance`](#enhance) and will be deprecated soon.
:::

### withPolicy

Use `withPolicy` to include enhancements of access policy (`@@allow` and `@@deny`) and field validation (`@length`, `@email`, etc.).

Access policies and validation rules are processed by the `@core/access-policy` plugin, which transforms the attributes into objects that can be loaded at runtime by default into `node_modules/.zenstack` folder. `withPolicy` function also loads from there by default.

If your access policy rules use the `auth()` function, evaluating it requires access to the current user's identity. You need to pass in a context user object that at least contains the user id.

#### Signature

```ts
function withPolicy<DbClient extends object>(
    prisma: DbClient,
    context?: WithPolicyContext,
    options?: WithPolicyOptions
): DbClient;
```

##### Parameter `prisma`

The PrismaClient instance to enhance.

##### Parameter `context`

The context to for evaluating access policies with the following typing.

```ts
type WithPolicyContext = {
    user?: Record<string, unknown>
};
```

| Field | Description | Default |
| ----- | ----------- | ------- |
| user  | The user object that provides value for the `auth()` function call in access policies. If provided. Its shape should be consistent with the `User` model in your ZModel, with all fields optional except for id field(s). Pass `undefined` to represent an anonymous user, and the `auth()` function call will evaluate to `null` in that case. | undefined |
