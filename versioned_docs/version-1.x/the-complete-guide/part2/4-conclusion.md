# Conclusion

In this part of the guide, we've focused on the plugin system of ZenStack. We've learned how to use plugins and how to write one.

ZModel contains a formal representation of how data is organized and its constraints. Besides serving as database schema and access control, it's an excellent source for powering other aspects of your app. Don't hesitate to write your own plugins when you feel the need.

In [Part III](../part3/) and [Part IV](../part4/) of the guide, you'll see in action how we use plugins to turn our Todo project from a schema to a full-stack application without writing much code.

The completed sample project up to the end of this part can be found in the "part2" branch of the [the-complete-guide-sample](https://github.com/zenstackhq/the-complete-guide-sample/tree/v1-part2) repo. You can clone it and check out to that branch with the following command:

```bash
git clone --branch v1-part2 https://github.com/zenstackhq/the-complete-guide-sample.git my-todo-app
```
