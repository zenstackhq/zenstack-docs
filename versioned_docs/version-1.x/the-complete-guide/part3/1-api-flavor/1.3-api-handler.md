# API Handlers

Although many different backend and full-stack frameworks exist in the Javascript world, how APIs are designed is entirely independent. We've implemented the API flavors as framework-agnostic API handlers. They take canonical input (HTTP verb, URL, body, etc.) and generate canonical output (status code and body).

The server adapters, as we will see in the next chapter, are responsible for dealing with the framework details and handling the transformation between the framework-specific request/response and the canonical format. If, in the future, we want to introduce a new API flavor, we don't need to change the server adapters.

The following diagram depicts the relationship between the API handlers and the server adapters:
