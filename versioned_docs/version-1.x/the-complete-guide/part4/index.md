# Part IV: Frontend Data Query

In previous parts of this guide, we have learned how ZenStack turns Prisma into a data access layer with access control and how, based on that, we can automatically serve secure CRUD APIs.

Consuming a CRUD API is straightforward, but it's a tedious and error-prone job if you do it manually. In this part, we'll see how ZenStack can help us generate frontend data query libraries (aka hooks) that make it effortless to consume the APIs from the frontend. We'll also continue evolving our Todo project into a full-fledged application.

Let's roll on!
