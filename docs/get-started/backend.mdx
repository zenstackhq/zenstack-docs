# Backend-only Usage

ZenStack gives you a pleasant type-safe approach for calling your database "directly"
from the frontend without coding a backend. Moreover, even if you're only building the
backend side of an app, it can still help by defining access policies right inside your
data model. This results in a security model that's both easier to maintain and more
reliable than a manually implemented one.

Let's have some fun by creating a simple blogging service with Express.js. You can find the final build result [here](https://github.com/zenstackhq/docs-tutorial-express).

## Requirements

Our target app should meet the following requirements:

1. Users can create posts for themselves.
1. Post owner can update/publish/unpublish/delete their own posts.
1. Users cannot make changes to posts that do not belong to them.
1. Published posts can be viewed by all users.

Let's get started ðŸš€.

## Prerequisite

1. Make sure you have Node.js 16 or above installed.
1. Install the [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zenstack.zenstack) for editing data models.

## Building the app

### 1. Create a new Prisma project

Prisma has a nice sample project for Express.js. Let's use it as a starting point:

```bash
# clone the sample project
npx degit prisma/prisma-examples/typescript/rest-express my-blog-app
cd my-blog-app

npm install

# push current Prisma schema to db
npx prisma db push

# seed the database
npx prisma db seed

# start the server
npm run dev
```

Now your server should be listening on port 3000 for RESTful requests.
First, let's add a simple API to list all posts:

```ts title='/src/index.ts'
app.get(`/post`, async (req, res) => {
    const post = await prisma.post.findMany({
        include: { author: true },
    });
    res.json(post);
});
```

Restart the server and verify it works by:

```bash
curl localhost:3000/post
```

You should see a list of posts like this:

```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "createdAt": "2023-01-14T06:46:52.628Z",
        "updatedAt": "2023-01-14T06:46:52.628Z",
        "title": "Join the Prisma Slack",
        "content": "https://slack.prisma.io",
        "published": true,
        "viewCount": 0,
        "authorId": 1,
        "author": { "id": 1, "email": "alice@prisma.io", "name": "Alice" }
    },
    ...
]
```

### 2. Initialize the project for ZenStack

Let's run the `zenstack` CLI to prepare your project for using ZenStack.

```bash
npx zenstack init
```

<InitTips />

### 3. Add access policies

Our bootstrapped `schema.zmodel` file already has a `User` and a `Post` model defined.
However, they don't carry any access policies. So if you use a plain Prisma client in the
backend code, anyone can do anything to any data unless you write some custom
authorization logic.

You need two things to secure it up:

1. Implement an authentication mechanism to identify the current user.
1. Implement authorization to control who can take which actions to what data.

#1 can usually be achieved by requiring a session cookie or a JWT token. For simplicity,
we'll skip this part in the tutorial and just pass user id in a plain `X-USER-ID` header.
We'll focus on #2 and utilize ZenStack to implement authorization without manually coding it.

Let's add the following access policies to the `User` and `Post` model to implement the
requirements we laid out previously:

```prisma {6-7,22-25} title='/schema.zmodel'
model User {
    id Int @id() @default(autoincrement())
    email String @unique()
    name String?
    posts Post[]

    // make user profile public
    @@allow('read', true)
}

model Post {
    id Int @id() @default(autoincrement())
    createdAt DateTime @default(now())
    updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt()
    title String
    content String?
    published Boolean @default(false)
    viewCount Int @default(0)
    author User? @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
    authorId Int?

    // author has full access
    @@allow('all', auth() == author)

    // logged-in users can view published posts
    @@allow('read', auth() != null && published)
}
```

<AccessPolicy />

Now flush the changes to the Prisma schema and database schema:

```bash
npx zenstack generate && npx prisma db push
```

### 4. Secure the APIs

Now let's secure up our APIs, leveraging the access policies.

First, add a simple middleware to require `X-USER-ID` header (to simulate authentication).
Make sure the following code is inserted above all express routes so it can be applied to
all endpoints.

```ts title='/src/index.ts'
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    const userId = req.header('X-USER-ID');
    if (!userId || Number.isNaN(parseInt(userId))) {
        res.status(403).json({ error: 'unauthorized' });
    } else {
        next();
    }
});
```

Next, add two helper methods to get a Prisma client that's bound to the current user identity:

```ts title='/src/index.ts'
import { Request } from 'express';
import { withPolicy } from '@zenstackhq/runtime';

function getUserId(req: Request) {
    return parseInt(req.header('X-USER-ID')!);
}

// Gets a Prisma client bound to the current user identity
function getPrisma(req: Request) {
    const userId = getUserId(req);
    const user = Number.isNaN(userId) ? undefined : { id: userId };
    return withPolicy(prisma, {
        user,
    });
}
```

:::tip

`withPolicy` is a ZenStack runtime API that wraps a Prisma client and enhances it with access policy checks.

:::

Then, change our `POST /post` API to use extracted user id instead of passing in user email in the body
when creating a new post:

```ts {6} title='/src/index.ts'
app.post(`/post`, async (req, res) => {
    const { title, content } = req.body;
    const result = await prisma.post.create({
        data: {
            title,
            content,
            author: { connect: { id: getUserId(req) } },
        },
    });
    res.json(result);
});
```

Finally, change all code that uses `prisma` to `getPrisma(req)`. Here I'm showing only one occurrence:

```ts {1} title='/src/index.ts'
app.get(`/post`, async (req, res) => {
    const post = await getPrisma(req).post.findMany({
        include: { author: true },
    });
    res.json(post);
});
```

Note that you don't need to change your Prisma query because the wrapped Prisma client has exactly the same API as the original Prisma client.

### 5. Test the secured backend

Now, restart the server and hit the `/post` endpoint again directly. You should get a 403 error:

```bash
curl -I localhost:3000/post
```

```plain
  HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
  X-Powered-By: Express
  Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
  Content-Length: 24
  ETag: W/"18-gH7/fIZxPCVRh6TuPVNAgHt/40I"
  Date: Sat, 14 Jan 2023 08:08:10 GMT
  Connection: keep-alive
  Keep-Alive: timeout=5
```

We can make it work by specifying `X-USER-ID` header:

```bash
curl -H "X-USER-ID: 1" localhost:3000/post
```

Let's create a new unpublished post for user#1:

```bash
curl --request POST \
    -H "X-USER-ID: 1" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"title": "My new post", "content": "Some awesome content"}' \
    localhost:3000/post
```

, and hit `/post` API again with user#1:

```bash
curl -H "X-USER-ID: 1" localhost:3000/post
```

You should see in the result the newly created post:

```json
[
    ...
    {
        "id": 4,
        "createdAt": "2023-01-14T08:42:56.833Z",
        "updatedAt": "2023-01-14T08:42:56.833Z",
        "title": "My new post",
        "content": "Some awesome content",
        "published": false,
        "viewCount": 0,
        "authorId": 1,
        "author": { "id": 1, "email": "alice@prisma.io", "name": "Alice" }
    }
]
```

However, if you hit `/post` API with user#2:

```bash
curl -H "X-USER-ID: 2" localhost:3000/post
```

, you won't see the new post because it's not published yet. Our access policies are at work.

Feel free to play more with updating and deleting posts with different user ids and see if the policies work as expected.

## Wrap up
