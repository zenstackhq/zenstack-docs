# Introduction

ZenStack is a Node.js/TypeScript toolkit that simplifies the development of a web app's backend. It supercharges [Prisma ORM](https://prisma.io) with a powerful access control layer and unleashes its full potential for full-stack development. We created it with the belief that developers can build better applications by:

- **Keeping a single source of truth for core business logic**
- **Being more declarative**
- **Writing less code**

To achieve these goals, ZenStack progressively enhances Prisma at multiple levels:

<ul>

🛠️ An extended schema language that supports custom attributes

🔐 Access policies and data validation rules

🚀 Automatic CRUD APIs - RESTful, tRPC

🤖 Generating client-side data access libraries (aka hooks) - SWR, TanStack Query

🧩 A plugin system for great extensibility

</ul>

        light: useBaseUrl('/img/intro/zenstack-layers-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/intro/zenstack-layers-dark.png'),
    }}
/>

In the following sections, we'll guide you through understanding each layer of the extensions, and you'll see how ZenStack can help you build a full-stack web app much faster.
