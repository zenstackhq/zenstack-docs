# Working With Relations

In the previous chapters, we've learned how to write basic policy rules involving model fields and the current user. However, real-world applications usually have authorization requirements that need to access relations. Here're some examples:

- A `Todo` is readable if its parent `TodoList` is not private.
- A `Post` is readable if the current user is a member of the `Organization` that the `Post` belongs to.

In this chapter, we'll learn how to write policy rules that involve relations.

### *-to-one Relations

Accessing *-to-one relation is straightforward. You simply reference the field directly. You can further visit the relation's fields using the dot notation.

```zmodel
model TodoList {
    id Int
    private Boolean
}

model Todo {
    id Int
    list TodoList @relation(...)

    // `list` references a to-one relation
    @@allow('update', !list.private)
}
```

You can chain the dot notation to make deep traversal in the relation graph. There's no limit on how deep you can go.

### *-to-many Relations

To-many relations are a bit more complicated because you're dealing with a list of objects instead of one. The authorization conditions written with to-many relations can be one of the following three forms:

- Does any of the objects in the list satisfy the condition?
- Does all of the objects in the list satisfy the condition?
- Does none of the objects in the list satisfy the condition?

ZenStack provides a succinct syntax called "Collection Predicate Expression" for writing such rules:

```
Any:  relation?[condition]
All:  relation![condition]
None: relation^[condition]
```

The `relation` part refers to a to-many relation field. The `condition` part is a boolean expression scoped to the type of `relation`. I.e., it can reference the member fields of `relation` without any qualification.

A collection predicate expression must start with a to-many relation field. You can't use a simple array field (like `String[]`) with it. In the next chapter you'll learn about helper functions that help you work with simple arrays.

### 🛠️ Adding Relation-Based Access Control To Our Todo App

Let's continue working on the schema of our Todo app and add policies that control data access for users within the same space.

```zmodel title="schema.zmodel"
model Space {
  ...

  // require login
  @@deny('all', auth() == null)

  // everyone can create a space
  @@allow('create', true)

  // users in the space can read the space
  @@allow('read', members?[user == auth()])

  // space admin can update and delete
  @@allow('update,delete', members?[user == auth() && role == 'ADMIN'])
}

model SpaceUser {
    ...

    // require login
    @@deny('all', auth() == null)

    // space admin can create/update/delete
    @@allow('create,update,delete', space.members?[user == auth() && role == 'ADMIN'])

    // user can read members of spaces that he's a member of
    @@allow('read', space.members?[user == auth()])
}

model User {
    ...

    // everyone can sign up
    @@allow('create', true)

    // full access by oneself
    @@allow('all', auth() == this)

    // can be read by users sharing any space
    @@allow('read', spaces?[space.members?[user == auth()]])
}

model List {
    ...

    // require login
    @@deny('all', auth() == null)

    // can be read by space members if not private
    @@allow('read', owner == auth() || (space.members?[user == auth()] && !private))

    // when create, owner must be set to current user, and user must be in the space
    @@allow('create,update', owner == auth() && space.members?[user == auth()])

    // can be deleted by owner
    @@allow('delete', owner == auth())
}

model Todo {
    ...

    // require login
    @@deny('all', auth() == null)

    // owner has full access
    @@allow('all', list.owner == auth())

    // space members have full access if the parent List is not private
    @@allow('all', list.space.members?[user == auth()] && !list.private)
}
```

Let's test it out. Rerun generation and start REPL:

```bash
npx zenstack generate
npx zenstack repl
```

Switch to user Joey and fetch Todo Lists:

```js
.auth { id: 1 }
db.list.findMany()
```

```js
[
  {
    id: 1,
    createdAt: 2023-11-08T04:38:53.385Z,
    updatedAt: 2023-11-08T04:38:53.385Z,
    spaceId: 1,
    ownerId: 2,
    title: 'Grocery',
    private: false
  }
]
```

We queried with user Joey and now can get the Todo List created by Rachel because Joey is a member of the same space.
