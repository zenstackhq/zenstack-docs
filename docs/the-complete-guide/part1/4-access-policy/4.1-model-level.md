# Model-Level Policies

The most frequently used access policies are those declared at the model level - written using the `@@allow` and `@@deny` model-level attributes.

:::info Model-level vs field-level attributes

ZenStack follows Prisma's convention: model-level attributes are prefixed with `@@`, and field-level attributes with `@`.

:::

Here's a basic example:

```zmodel
model Post {
    id Int @id
    title String
    published Boolean @default(false)

    // published posts are readable
    @@allow('read', published)
}
```

You can also achieve the same goal with `@@deny`:

```zmodel
model Post {
    id Int @id
    title String
    published Boolean @default(false)

    @@allow('read', true)
    @@deny('read', !published)
}
```

Both `@@allow` and `@@deny` take two arguments: 

1. Operation
   
   `create`, `read`, `update`, `delete`, or a comma-separated list of them. You can also use `all` to abbreviate all operations.

2. Condition: a boolean expression

    You can use boolean literals: `true` and `false`. Operators `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, and `<=` can be used to compare values. You can also use `&&`, `||`, and `!` to compose boolean expressions.

    There are functions and special expressions that help you write more advanced conditions. We'll cover them in later chapters.

### Evaluation of Model-Level Policies

You can write as many policy rules as you want for a model. The order of the rules doesn't matter.

ZenStack determines whether a CRUD operation is allowed using the following logic:

1. If any `@@deny` rule evaluates to true, it's denied.
1. If any `@@allow` rule evaluates to true, it's allowed.
1. Otherwise, it's denied (secure by default).

Each of the CRUD operation types governs a set of Prisma Client methods, as follows:

- **create**
  
    `create`, `createMany`, `upsert`, and `create`/`createMany`/`connectOrCreate` nested in create/update calls.

- **read**
  
    `findMany`, `findUnique`, `findUniqueOrThrow`, `findFirst`, `findFirstOrThrow`, `count`, `aggregate`, and `groupBy`.
    
    The "read" operation also determines whether the value returned from `create`, `update` and `delete` method can be read.

- **update**

    `update`, `updateMany`, `upsert`, and `update`/`updateMany`/`set`/`connect`/`connectOrCreate`/`disconnect` nested in create/update calls.

- **delete**

    `delete`, `deleteMany`, and `delete` nested in update calls.

:::info Relation manipulation and policies

When a Prisma call involves relation manipulation, it can be unobvious which side the relation needs to satisfy the "update" policies. For example, given the following model:

```zmodel
model User {
    ...
    posts Post[]
}

model Post {
    ...
    author User @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
    authorId Int
}
```

If we add a post to a user like:

```ts

db.user.update({
    where: { id: 1 },
    data: {
        posts: { connect: { id: 1 } }
    }
})
```

Does `Post#1` need to satisfy its "update" policies?

The trick is to consider which side of the relation will have a foreign key update. In this example, the foreign key `authorId` of `Post#1` will be updated, so `Post#1` needs to satisfy its "update" policies, and `User`'s "update" policies are not relevant.

A special case is Prisma's [implicit many-to-many relation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/relations/many-to-many-relations#implicit-many-to-many-relations). Since there are no explicit foreign keys in this case, manipulating such a relation requires both sides to satisfy the "update" policies.

### How Do Policies Affect Prisma Client's Behavior?

Enforcing access policies causes an enhanced Prisma Client to behave differently from the original. You can predict what happens with the following principles:

- Read methods behave as if the rows not satisfying the policies don't exist

    For example, `findMany` only returns rows that satisfy the policies. `count` only counts rows that satisfy the policies. This applies to nested reads as well. ZenStack enforces "read" policies by injecting `where` clauses into the Prisma query.

:::warning Nested read can filter out parent records

There's one thing that may catch you off guard. When you do a find and include a to-one relation field, if the field is not nullable and cannot be ready by the current user, it'll result in the parent record being filtered out. For example:

```ts
// if `author` is not readable, the parent `Post` is excluded
const posts = await db.post.findMany({ include: { author: true }});
```

The reason for this design choice is two-fold:

1. Type safety

    If we silently drop the `author` field, we'll break type-safety because the `author` field is not optional in its TS definition.

2. Performance

    Prisma doesn't provide a direct way to include a non-nullable to-one relation conditionally. If we choose to drop the field, we'll have to do post-read processing, which may require additional database queries.

:::

- Bulk update and bulk delete methods behave as if the rows that don't satisfy the policies don't exist

    For example, `updateMany` only updates rows that satisfy the policies. Same for `deleteMany`. ZenStack enforces "update" and "delete" policies by injecting `where` clauses into the Prisma query.

- Other write methods throw errors if the corresponding policies are not satisfied

    For example, `create` throws an error if the policies are not satisfied. When possible, ZenStack determines policy satisfaction by inspecting the input object of the Prisma query. Otherwise, it wraps the write into a transaction and checks the policies after the write is complete but before the transaction commits.

    If a nested write causes a policy violation, the top-level write will be rejected as a whole.

:::info A write can imply a read

Here's another fun fact about access policies. A `create`, `update` or `delete` call may succeed but still throw an error. Why?

The reason is that a write can imply a read. When you call `db.user.create`, the created result will be returned and subject to the "read" policy check. If it fails, an error will be thrown even though the write is persisted.

### 🛠️ Giving It a Try

Let's continue working on our Todo app and add some access policies. Add the following rule to the `User` model:

```zmodel title="schema.zmodel"
model User {
    ...

    @@allow('read', startsWith(email, 'joey'))
}
```

:::info
`startsWith` is an attribute function that checks whether a field starts with a given string. We'll cover functions in detail in [Expressions and Functions](./expr-func).
:::

Then rerun generation and start the REPL:

```bash
npx zenstack generate
npx zenstack repl
```

Now query users with the enhanced Prisma Client:

```js
db.user.findMany();
```

This time, we should get back a user. Our policy rule is working!

```js
[
  {
    id: 1,
    createdAt: 2023-11-07T21:37:22.506Z,
    updatedAt: 2023-11-07T21:37:22.506Z,
    email: 'joey@zenstack.dev',
    name: 'Joey'
  }
]
```

You'll still encounter an error if you try to create a user since we haven't added any "create" rule yet:

```js
db.user.create({ data: { email: 'ross@zenstack.dev', name: 'Ross' } });
```

```js
denied by policy: user entities failed 'create' check
Code: P2004
Meta: { reason: 'ACCESS_POLICY_VIOLATION' }
```

### Next

Using only the direct fields of a model for access control isn't super useful. In the following chapters, you'll learn how to the requesting user's information and relation fields to write more advanced rules.
