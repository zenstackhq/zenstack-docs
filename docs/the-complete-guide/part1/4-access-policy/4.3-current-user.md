# Accessing Current User

In most cases, whether a CRUD operation is allowed depends on the current user. ZenStack provides a special function `auth()` to access the current user in policy rules.

### Auth Model

When ZModel is compiled, the `auth()` function needs to be resolved to a data model so that the compiler knows which fields are accessible from the function. By default, the model named "User" is used as the auth model. Here's an example:

```zmodel
model User {
    id Int @id
    role String
    posts Post[]
}

model Post {
    id Int @id
    title String
    author User @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
    authorId Int

    // ‚úÖ valid rule
    @@allow('all', auth().role == 'ADMIN')

    // ‚ùå invalid rule, `subscribed` field doesn't exist in `User` model
    @@allow('all', auth().subscribed == true) 
}
```

You can use a model not named `User` as the auth model by adding the `@@auth` attribute to it.

```zmodel
model MyUser {
    id Int @id
    role String
    posts Post[]

    @@auth
}
```

:::info What if I don't store users in the database?

If you use an external authentication service like Clerk or Supabase Auth, you can choose not to store users in the database, since the auth services are already doing this for you. However, in ZModel, the `auth()` function call always needs to be resolved to a typing.

The solution is to use a `type` instead of a `model` to define the shape of `auth()`. A `type` can contain fields as models do, the it's not mapped to a database table, and only serves the purpose of typing.

```zmodel
type User {
    id String @id
    ...
}
```

Since `User` is not mapped to a database table, you can't have other models to have relations to it. Instead, you can store the user id provided by the authentication service in your models, which is like a "foreign key" but pointing to an external system.

:::

### Providing Current User

Since ZenStack is not an authentication solution, it doesn't know who the current user is. It's up to the developer to get it from the authentication side and pass it to ZenStack (when calling the `enhance` function).

Here's the pseudo-code:

```ts

// `getCurrentUser` is an authentication API that extracts 
// the current user from the request
const user = await getCurrentUser(request);

// create an enhanced Prisma Client for the user, the `user` object
// provides value for the `auth()` function in policy rules
const db = enhance(prisma, { user })
```

The minimum requirement for the `user` object is to have a value for the "id" field of the auth model (if the model uses compound id fields, all fields need to be assigned). However, if your access policies involve other fields of the auth model, you need to provide them as well. 

:::warning Provide all fields needed by policy rules

ZenStack doesn't query the database automatically to fetch the missing fields, but you can do that as needed. Let's say if you have a policy rule like:

```zmodel
@@allow('update', auth().role == 'ADMIN')
```

Before calling `enhance()`, you can hit the database (using the original Prisma Client) to fetch the user's role:

```ts
const userId = getCurrentUserId(request);
const user = await prisma.user.findUniqueOrThrow({ where: { id: userId }, select: { id: true, role: true } });
const db = enhance(prisma, { user });
```

In the future, we may introduce a new option to control if the missing fields should be automatically fetched from the database.

:::

### Writing Conditions With `auth()`

#### Checking Anonymous User

You can indicate that the current user is anonymous by not passing the `user` object (or passing `undefined`) when calling `enhance`:

```ts
const db = enhance(prisma);
```

In policy rules, check `auth() == null` for anonymous user:

```zmodel
model Post {
    ...

    // allow all login users to read
    @@allow('read', auth() != null)
}
```

#### Comparing `auth()` With Other Fields

You can compare `auth()` against a field of the same type (i.e., the auth model). Such comparison is equivalent to an id field comparison. For example, the following policy rule:

```zmodel
model Post {
    ...
    author User @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
    authorId Int
    @@allow('update', auth() == author)
}
```

is equivalent to:

```zmodel
model Post {
    ...
    author User @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
    authorId Int
    @@allow('update', auth().id == author.id)
}
```

, and is also equivalent to:

```zmodel
model Post {
    ...
    author User @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
    authorId Int
    @@allow('update', auth().id == authorId)
}
```

#### Traversing Relation Fields

You can access auth model's relation fields from `auth()` function and chain them with other fields. Remember ZenStack doesn't fetch the fields accessed from `auth()` automatically, so you need to provide them (recursively if there's multi-level traversing) when calling `enhance()`.

```zmodel
model User {
    ...
    role Role
}

model Role {
    ...
    permissions Permission[]
}

model Permission {
    ...
    name String  // READ, WRITE, etc.
}

model Post {
    ...

    @@allow('read', auth().role.permissions?[name == 'READ'])
}
```

:::info

The `expression?[condition]` syntax used above is called "Collection Predicate Expression". It's used for computing a boolean value from a "*-to-many" relation field. You'll learn more about it in the next chapter.

:::

### Using `auth()` in `@default()`

Another very useful place to use `auth()` is in the `@default()` attribute. It's common to require a resource's owner to be the current user when creating an entity. You can use a "create" rule to enforce that:

```zmodel
model Resource {
    ...
    owner User @relation(fields: [ownerId], references: [id])
    ownerId Int

    @@allow('create', owner == auth())
}
```

The policy ensures that the caller can't set a resource's owner to someone else. However, when making a create call, you'll still need to connect the owner:
  
```ts
await db.resource.create({ data: { ..., owner: { connect: { id: currentUser.id } } } });
```

This can be simplified by using `auth()` in the `@default()` attribute:

```zmodel
model Resource {
    ...
    owner User @relation(fields: [ownerId], references: [id])
    ownerId Int @default(auth().id)

    @@allow('create', owner == auth())
}
```

Now, when creating a resource, you don't need to explicitly make the owner connection.

### üõ†Ô∏è Adding User-Based Access Control {#add-user-based-access-control}

Add the following policies and default values to the schema:

```zmodel title="schema.zmodel"
model User {
  ...

  // everyone can sign up
  @@allow('create', true)

  // full access by oneself
  @@allow('all', auth() == this)
}

model Space {
  ...

  ownerId Int @default(auth().id)
}

model List {
  ...

  ownerId Int @default(auth().id)

  // owner has full access
  @@allow('all', auth() == owner)
}

model Todo {
  ...

  ownerId Int @default(auth().id)

  // owner and list owner has full access
  @@allow('all', auth() == owner || auth() == list.owner)
}
```

Rerun generation and start REPL:

```bash
npx zenstack generate
npx zenstack repl
```

:::info Setting Current User

The REPL provides a ".auth" command for setting the current user. The user object passed to the command will serve value for the `auth()` function in policy rules at runtime. Run ".auth" without arguments to switch back to the anonymous user.

:::

Switch to user#1 and make a query:

```js
.auth { id: 1 }
db.user.findMany();
```

```js
[
  {
    id: 1,
    createdAt: 2023-11-07T21:37:22.506Z,
    updatedAt: 2023-11-07T21:37:22.506Z,
    email: 'joey@zenstack.dev',
    name: 'Joey'
  }
]
```

Switch to user#2 and observe the difference:

```js
.auth { id: 2 }
db.user.findMany();
```

```js
[
  {
    id: 2,
    createdAt: 2023-11-07T21:37:22.509Z,
    updatedAt: 2023-11-07T21:37:22.509Z,
    email: 'rachel@zenstack.dev',
    name: 'Rachel'
  }
]
```

We can also create Todo List now:

```js
db.list.create({ data: { title: 'Grocery', space: { connect: { slug: 'central-perk' } } } })
```

```js
{
  id: 1,
  createdAt: 2023-11-08T04:38:53.385Z,
  updatedAt: 2023-11-08T04:38:53.385Z,
  spaceId: 1,
  ownerId: 2,
  title: 'Grocery',
  private: false
}
```

:::tip
Notice that we don't need to connect the `owner` relation when creating? The `@default(auth().id)` attribute takes care of it.
:::

However, as user Rachel, we can't create a Todo List on behalf of Joey because it violates the `@@allow('all', auth() == owner)` rule:

```js
db.list.create({ data: { title: 'Grocery', owner: { connect: { email: 'joey@zenstack.dev' } }, space: { connect: { slug: 'central-perk' } } } })
```

```js
denied by policy: list entities failed 'create' check, entity { id: 2 } failed policy check
Code: P2004
Meta: { reason: 'ACCESS_POLICY_VIOLATION' }
```

---

Allowing only the owners to read and write their own data is a good start, but we would like to let users in the same `Space` to collaborate on the Todo lists and items in the space. Achieving this requires traversing relations in policy rules, which we'll cover in the next chapter.
