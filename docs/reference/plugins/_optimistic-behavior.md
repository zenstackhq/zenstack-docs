- `create` mutation inserts item to the head of the query results of the corresponding `useFindMany` queries.
- `update` mutation updates the item in the query results of `useFindXXX` queries and their nested reads by matching the item's ID.
- `upsert` mutation first tries to update the item in the query results of `useFindXXX` queries and their nested reads by matching the item's ID. If the item is not found, it inserts the item to the head of the query results.
- `delete` mutation removes the item from the query results of the corresponding `useFindMany` queries and sets `null` to `useFindUnique` and `useFindFirst` query results, by matching the item's ID.
