# RESTful API Handler

The RESTful-style API handler exposes CRUD APIs as RESTful endpoints using [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/) as transportation format. The API handler is not meant to be used directly; instead, you should use it together with a [server adapter](/docs/category/server-adapters) which handles the request and response API for a specific framework.

It can be created as the following:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="next" label="Next.js">

```ts title='/src/pages/api/model/[...path].ts'
import { NextRequestHandler } from '@zenstackhq/server/next';
import RestApiHandler from '@zenstackhq/server/api/rest';
import { getPrisma } from '../../lib/db';

export default NextRequestHandler({ 
    getPrisma,
    handler: RestApiHandler({ endpoint: 'http://myhost/api' }) 
});
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="sveltekit" label="SvelteKit">

```ts title='/src/hooks.server.ts'
import zenstack from '@zenstackhq/server/sveltekit';
import RestApiHandler from '@zenstackhq/server/api/rest';
import { getPrisma } from './lib/db';

export const handle = zenstack.SvelteKitHandler({
    prefix: '/api/model',
    getPrisma,
    handler: RestApiHandler({ endpoint: 'http://myhost/api/model' })
});
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="nuxt" label="Nuxt">

```
🚧 Coming soon
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

The factory function accepts an options object with the following fields:

- endpoint

  Required. A `string` field representing the base URL of the RESTful API, used for generating resource links.

- pageSize

  Optional. A `number` field representing the default page size for listing resources and relationships. Defaults to 100. Set to Infinity to disable pagination.

## Endpoints and Features

The RESTful API handler conforms to the the [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/format/) v1.1 specification for its URL design and input/output format. The following sections list the endpoints and features are implemented. The examples refer to the following schema modeling a blogging app:

```zmodel
model User {
    id Int @id @default(autoincrement())
    email String
    posts Post[]
}

model Profile {
    id Int @id @default(autoincrement())
    gender String
    user User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
    userId Int @unique
}

model Post {
    id Int @id @default(autoincrement())
    title String
    published Boolean @default(false)
    viewCount Int @default(0)
    author User @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
    authorId Int
    comments Comment[]
}

model Comment {
    id Int @id @default(autoincrement())
    content String
    post Post @relation(fields: [postId], references: [id])
    postId Int
}
```

### Listing resources

A specific type of resource can be listed using the following endpoint:

```
GET /:type
```

#### Status codes

- 200: The request was successful and the response body contains the requested resources.
- 400: The request was malformed.
- 403: The request was forbidden.
- 404: The requested resource type does not exist.

#### Examples

```ts
GET /post
```

```json
{
    "meta": {
        "total": 1
    },
    "data": [
        {
            "attributes": {
                "authorId": 1,

   },
   "links" : {
      "self" : "http://myhost/api/post/1/author"
   }
}
```

### Fine-grained data fetching

#### Filtering

You can use the `filter[:selector1][:selector2][...]=value` [query parameter family](https://jsonapi.org/format/#query-parameters-families) to filter resource collections or relationship collections.

##### Examples

1. Equality filter against plain field

    ```ts
    GET /api/post?filter[published]=false
    ```

1. Equality filter against relationship

    Relationship field can be filtered directly by its id.

    ```ts
    GET /api/post?filter[author]=1
    ```

    If the relationship is to-many, the filter has "some" semantic and evaluates to `true` if any of the items in the relationship matches.

    ```ts
    GET /api/user?filter[posts]=1
    ```

1. Filtering with multiple values

    Multiple filter values can be separated by comma. Items statisfying any of the values will be returned.

    ```ts
    GET /api/post?filter[author]=1,2
    ```

1. Multiple filters

    A request can carry multiple filters. Only items statisfying all filters will be returned.

    ```ts
    GET /api/post?filter[author]=1&filter[published]=true
    ```

1. Deep filtering

    A filter can carry multiple field selectors to reach into relationships.

    ```ts
    GET /api/post?filter[author][name]=Emily
    ```

    When reaching into a to-many relationship, the filter has "some" semantic and evaluates to `true` if any of the items in the relationship matches.

    ```
    GET /api/user?filter[posts][published]=true
    ```
    
1. Filtering with comparison operators

    Filters can go beyond equality by appending an "operator suffix".

    ```ts
    GET /api/post?filter[viewCount$gt]=100
    ```

    The following operators are supported:

    - **$lt**

        Less than

    - **$lte**
    
        Less than or equal to

    - **$gt**
    
        Greater than

    - **$gte**
    
        Greater than or equal to

    - **$contains**
        
        String contains

    - **$icontains**
    
        Case-insensitive string contains

    - **$search**
        
        String full-text search

    - **$startsWith**
        
        String starts with

    - **$endsWith**
    
        String ends with

    - **$has**
    
        Collection has value

    - **$hasEvery**
    
        Collection has every element in value

    - **$hasSome**
    
        Collection has some elements in value

    - **$isEmpty**
    
        Collection is empty

#### Sorting

You can use the `sort` query parameter to sort resource collections or relationship collections. The value of the parameter is a comma-separated list of fields names. The order of the fields in the list determines the order of sorting. By default, sorting is done in ascending order. To sort in descending order, prefix the field name with a minus sign.

##### Examples

```ts
GET /api/post?sort=createdAt,-viewCount
```

#### Pagination

When creating a RESTful API handler, you can pass in a `pageSize` option to control pagination behavior of fetching a collection of resources, related resources, and relationships. By default the page size is 100, and you can disable pagination by setting `pageSize` option to `Infinity`.

When fetching a collection resource or relationship, you can use the `page[offset]=value` and `page[limit]=value` [query parameter family](https://jsonapi.org/format/#query-parameters-families) to fetch a specific page. They're mapped to `skip` and `take` parameters in the query arguments sent to PrismaClient.

The response data of collection fetching contains pagination links that facilitate navigating through the collection. The "meta" section also contains the total count available. E.g.:

```json
{
    "meta": {
        "total": 10
    },
    "data" : [
        ...
    ],
    "links" : {
        "first" : "http://myhost/api/post?page%5Blimit%5D=2",
        "last" : "http://myhost/api/post?page%5Boffset%5D=4",
        "next" : "http://myhost/api/post?page%5Boffset%5D=4&page%5Blimit%5D=2",
        "prev" : "http://myhost/api/post?page%5Boffset%5D=0&page%5Blimit%5D=2",
        "self" : "http://myhost/api/post"
    }
}
```

##### Examples

1. Fetching a specific page of resources

    ```ts
    GET /api/post?page[offset]=10&page[limit]=5
    ```

1. Fetching a specific page of relationships

    ```ts
    GET /api/user/1/relationships/posts?page[offset]=10&page[limit]=5
    ```

1. Fetching a specific page of related resources

    ```ts
    GET /api/user/1/posts?page[offset]=10&page[limit]=5
    ```

#### Including related resources

You can use the `include` query parameter to include related resources in the response. The value of the parameter is a comma-separated list of fields names. Field names can contain dots to reach into nested relationships.

When including related resources, the response data takes the form of [Compound Documents](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-compound-documents) and contains a `included` field carrying normalized related resources. E.g.:

```json
{
   "data" : [
      {
         "attributes" : {
            ...
         },
         "id" : 1,
         "relationships" : {
            "author" : {
               "data" : { "id" : 1, "type" : "user" }
            }
         },
         "type" : "post"
      }
   ],
   "included" : [
      {
         "attributes" : {
            "email" : "emily@zenstack.dev",
            "name" : "Emily"
         },
         "id" : 1,
         "links" : {
            "self" : "http://myhost/api/user/1"
         },
         "relationships" : {
            "posts" : {
               "links" : {
                  "related" : "http://myhost/api/user/1/posts",
                  "self" : "http://myhost/api/user/1/relationships/posts"
               }
            }
         },
         "type" : "user"
      }
   ]
}
```

##### Examples

1. Including a direct relationship

    ```ts
    GET /api/post?include=author
    ```

1. Including a deep relationship

    ```ts
    GET /api/post?include=author.profile
    ```

1. Including multiple relationships

    ```ts
    GET /api/post?include=author,comments
    ```

### Creating a resource

A new resource can be created using the following endpoint:

```
POST /:type
```

#### Status codes

- 201: The request was successful and the resource was created.
- 400: The request was malformed.
- 403: The request was forbidden.
- 404: The requested resource type does not exist.

#### Examples

1. Creating a resource
    ```json
    POST /user
    {
        "data": {
            "type": "user",
            "attributes": {
                "name": "Emily",
                "email": "emily@zenstack.dev"
            }
        }
    }
    ```

1. Creating a resource with relationships attached

    ```json
    POST /user
    {
        "data": {
            "type": "user",
            "attributes": {
                "name": "Emily",
                "email": "emily@zenstack.dev"
            },
            "relationships": {
                "posts": {
                    "data": [{ "type": "post", "id": 1 }]
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

### Updating a resource

A resource can be updated using the following endpoints:

```ts
PUT /:type/:id
PATCH /:type/:id
```

Both `PUT` and `PATCH` do partial update and has exactly the same behavior.

:::info
Besides plain fields, you can also include relationships in the request body. Please note that this won't update the related resource; instead if only replaces the relationships. If you update a to-many relationship, the new collection will entirely replace the old one.

Relationships can also be manipulated directly. See [Manipulating Relationships](#manipulating-relationships) for more details.
:::

#### Status codes

- 200: The request was successful and the resource was updated.
- 400: The request was malformed.
- 403: The request was forbidden.

    {
        "data": null
    }
    ```

## Error Handling

An error response is an object containing the following fields:

- errors

    An array of error objects, each containing the following fields:

    - code: `string`, error code
    - status: `number`, HTTP status code
    - title: `string`, error title
    - detail: `string`, error detail
    - prismaCode: `string`, Prisma error code, if the error is thrown by Prisma

### Example

```json
{
   "errors" : [
      {
         "code" : "unsupported-model",
         "detail" : "Model foo doesn't exist",
         "status" : 404,
         "title" : "Unsupported model type"
      }
   ]
}
```
