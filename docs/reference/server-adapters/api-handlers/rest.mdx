# RESTful API Handler

## Introduction

The RESTful-style API handler exposes CRUD APIs as RESTful endpoints using [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/) as transportation format. The API handler is not meant to be used directly; instead, you should use it together with a [server adapter](../../../category/server-adapters) which handles the request and response API for a specific framework.

It can be created as the following:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="next" label="Next.js">

```ts title='/src/app/api/model/[...path]/route.ts'
import { NextRequestHandler } from '@zenstackhq/server/next';
import { RestApiHandler } from '@zenstackhq/server/api';
import { getPrisma } from '~/lib/db';

const handler = NextRequestHandler({
    getPrisma,
    useAppDir: true,
    handler: RestApiHandler({ endpoint: 'http://myhost/api' })    
});

export {
  handler as GET,
  handler as POST,
  handler as PUT,
  handler as PATCH,
  handler as DELETE,
};
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="sveltekit" label="SvelteKit">

```ts title='/src/hooks.server.ts'
import { SvelteKitHandler } from '@zenstackhq/server/sveltekit';
import { RestApiHandler } from '@zenstackhq/server/api';
import { getPrisma } from './lib/db';

export const handle = SvelteKitHandler({
    prefix: '/api/model',
    getPrisma,
    handler: RestApiHandler({ endpoint: 'http://myhost/api/model' })
});
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="nuxt" label="Nuxt">

```ts title='/server/api/model/[...].ts'
import { createEventHandler } from '@zenstackhq/server/nuxt';
import { RestApiHandler } from '@zenstackhq/server/api';
import { getPrisma } from './lib/db';

export default createEventHandler({
    handler: RestApiHandler({ endpoint: 'http://myhost/api/model' })
    getPrisma
});
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

The factory function accepts an options object with the following fields:

- endpoint

  Required. A `string` field representing the base URL of the RESTful API, used for generating resource links.

- pageSize

  Optional. A `number` field representing the default page size for listing resources and relationships. Defaults to 100. Set to Infinity to disable pagination.

## Endpoints and Features

The RESTful API handler conforms to the the [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/format/) v1.1 specification for its URL design and input/output format. The following sections list the endpoints and features are implemented. The examples refer to the following schema modeling a blogging app:

```zmodel
model User {
    id Int @id @default(autoincrement())
    email String
    posts Post[]
}

model Profile {
    id Int @id @default(autoincrement())
    gender String
    user User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
    userId Int @unique
}

model Post {
    id Int @id @default(autoincrement())
    title String
    published Boolean @default(false)
    viewCount Int @default(0)
    author User @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
    authorId Int
    comments Comment[]
}

model Comment {
    id Int @id @default(autoincrement())
    content String
    post Post @relation(fields: [postId], references: [id])
    postId Int
}
```

### Listing resources

A specific type of resource can be listed using the following endpoint:

```
GET /:type
```

#### Status codes

- 200: The request was successful and the response body contains the requested resources.
- 400: The request was malformed.
- 403: The request was forbidden.
- 404: The requested resource type does not exist.
- 422: The request violated data validation rules.

#### Examples

```ts
GET /post
```

```json
{
    "meta": {
        "total": 1
    },
    "data": [
        {
            "attributes": {
                "authorId": 1,
                "published": true,
                "title": "My Awesome Post",
                "viewCount": 0
            },
            "id": 1,
            "links": {
                "self": "http://myhost/api/post/1"

                "author": {
                    "data": { "id": 1, "type": "user" },
                    "links": {
                        "related": "http://myhost/api/post/1/author/1",
                        "self": "http://myhost/api/post/1/relationships/author/1"
                    }
                }
            },
            "type": "post"
        }
    ],
    "jsonapi": {
        "version": "1.1"
    },
    "links": {
        "first": "http://myhost/api/post?page%5Blimit%5D=100",
        "last": "http://myhost/api/post?page%5Boffset%5D=0",
        "next": null,
        "prev": null,
        "self": "http://myhost/api/post"
    }
}
```

### Fetching a resource

A unique resource can be fetched using the following endpoint:

```ts
GET /:type/:id
```

#### Status codes

- 200: The request was successful and the response body contains the requested resource.
- 400: The request was malformed.
- 403: The request was forbidden.
- 404: The requested resource type or ID does not exist.

#### Examples

```ts
GET /post/1
```

```json
{
    "data": {
        "attributes": {
            "authorId": 1,
            "published": true,
            "title": "My Awesome Post",
            "viewCount": 0
        },
        "id": 1,
        "links": {
            "self": "http://myhost/api/post/1"
        },
        "relationships": {

                    "related": "http://myhost/api/post/1/author/1",
                    "self": "http://myhost/api/post/1/relationships/author/1"
                }
            }
        },
        "type": "post"
    },
    "jsonapi": {
        "version": "1.1"
    },
    "links": {
        "self": "http://myhost/api/post/1"
    }
}
```

### Fetching relationships

A resource's relationships can be fetched using the following endpoint:

```ts
GET /:type/:id/relationships/:relationship
```

#### Status codes

- 200: The request was successful and the response body contains the requested relationships.

    GET /post/1/relationships/author
    ```

    ```json
    {
        "data" : { "id" : 1, "type" : "user" },
        "jsonapi" : {
            "version" : "1.1"
        },
        "links" : {
            "self" : "http://myhost/api/post/1/relationships/author"
        }
    }
    ```

1. Fetching a to-many relationship

    ```ts

{
   "data" : {
      "attributes" : {
         "email" : "emily@zenstack.dev",
         "name" : "Emily"
      },

               "self" : "http://myhost/api/user/1/relationships/posts"
            }
         }
      },
      "type" : "user"
   },
   "jsonapi" : {
      "version" : "1.1"
   },
   "links" : {
      "self" : "http://myhost/api/post/1/author"
   }
}
```

### Fine-grained data fetching

#### Filtering

You can use the `filter[:selector1][:selector2][...]=value` [query parameter family](https://jsonapi.org/format/#query-parameters-families) to filter resource collections or relationship collections.

##### Examples

1. Equality filter against plain field

    ```ts
    GET /api/post?filter[published]=false
    ```

1. Equality filter against relationship

    Relationship field can be filtered directly by its id.

    ```ts
    GET /api/post?filter[author]=1
    ```

    If the relationship is to-many, the filter has "some" semantic and evaluates to `true` if any of the items in the relationship matches.

    ```ts
    GET /api/user?filter[posts]=1
    ```

1. Filtering with multiple values

    Multiple filter values can be separated by comma. Items statisfying any of the values will be returned.

    ```ts
    GET /api/post?filter[author]=1,2
    ```

1. Multiple filters

    A request can carry multiple filters. Only items statisfying all filters will be returned.

    ```ts
    GET /api/post?filter[author]=1&filter[published]=true
    ```

1. Deep filtering

    A filter can carry multiple field selectors to reach into relationships.

    ```ts
    GET /api/post?filter[author][name]=Emily
    ```

    When reaching into a to-many relationship, the filter has "some" semantic and evaluates to `true` if any of the items in the relationship matches.

    ```
    GET /api/user?filter[posts][published]=true
    ```
    
1. Filtering with comparison operators

    Filters can go beyond equality by appending an "operator suffix".

    ```ts
    GET /api/post?filter[viewCount$gt]=100
    ```

    The following operators are supported:

    - **$lt**

        Less than

    - **$lte**
    
        Less than or equal to

    - **$gt**
    
        Greater than

    - **$gte**
    
        Greater than or equal to

    - **$contains**
        
        String contains

    - **$icontains**
    
        Case-insensitive string contains

    - **$search**
        
        String full-text search

    - **$startsWith**
        
        String starts with

    - **$endsWith**
    
        String ends with

    - **$has**
    
        Collection has value

    - **$hasEvery**
    
        Collection has every element in value

    - **$hasSome**
    
        Collection has some elements in value

    - **$isEmpty**
    
        Collection is empty

#### Sorting

You can use the `sort` query parameter to sort resource collections or relationship collections. The value of the parameter is a comma-separated list of fields names. The order of the fields in the list determines the order of sorting. By default, sorting is done in ascending order. To sort in descending order, prefix the field name with a minus sign.

##### Examples

```ts
GET /api/post?sort=createdAt,-viewCount
```

#### Pagination

When creating a RESTful API handler, you can pass in a `pageSize` option to control pagination behavior of fetching a collection of resources, related resources, and relationships. By default the page size is 100, and you can disable pagination by setting `pageSize` option to `Infinity`.

When fetching a collection resource or relationship, you can use the `page[offset]=value` and `page[limit]=value` [query parameter family](https://jsonapi.org/format/#query-parameters-families) to fetch a specific page. They're mapped to `skip` and `take` parameters in the query arguments sent to PrismaClient.

The response data of collection fetching contains pagination links that facilitate navigating through the collection. The "meta" section also contains the total count available. E.g.:

```json
{
    "meta": {
        "total": 10
    },
    "data" : [
        ...
    ],
    "links" : {
        "first" : "http://myhost/api/post?page%5Blimit%5D=2",
        "last" : "http://myhost/api/post?page%5Boffset%5D=4",
        "next" : "http://myhost/api/post?page%5Boffset%5D=4&page%5Blimit%5D=2",
        "prev" : "http://myhost/api/post?page%5Boffset%5D=0&page%5Blimit%5D=2",
        "self" : "http://myhost/api/post"
    }
}
```

##### Examples

1. Fetching a specific page of resources

    ```ts
    GET /api/post?page[offset]=10&page[limit]=5
    ```

1. Fetching a specific page of relationships

    ```ts
    GET /api/user/1/relationships/posts?page[offset]=10&page[limit]=5
    ```

1. Fetching a specific page of related resources

    ```ts
    GET /api/user/1/posts?page[offset]=10&page[limit]=5
    ```

#### Including related resources

You can use the `include` query parameter to include related resources in the response. The value of the parameter is a comma-separated list of fields names. Field names can contain dots to reach into nested relationships.

When including related resources, the response data takes the form of [Compound Documents](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-compound-documents) and contains a `included` field carrying normalized related resources. E.g.:

```json
{
   "data" : [
      {
         "attributes" : {
            ...
         },
         "id" : 1,
         "relationships" : {
            "author" : {
               "data" : { "id" : 1, "type" : "user" }
            }
         },
         "type" : "post"
      }
   ],
   "included" : [
      {
         "attributes" : {
            "email" : "emily@zenstack.dev",
            "name" : "Emily"
         },
         "id" : 1,
         "links" : {
            "self" : "http://myhost/api/user/1"
         },
         "relationships" : {
            "posts" : {
               "links" : {
                  "related" : "http://myhost/api/user/1/posts",
                  "self" : "http://myhost/api/user/1/relationships/posts"
               }
            }
         },
         "type" : "user"
      }
   ]
}
```

##### Examples

1. Including a direct relationship

    ```ts
    GET /api/post?include=author
    ```

1. Including a deep relationship

    ```ts
    GET /api/post?include=author.profile
    ```

1. Including multiple relationships

    ```ts
    GET /api/post?include=author,comments
    ```

### Creating a resource

A new resource can be created using the following endpoint:

```
POST /:type
```

#### Status codes

- 201: The request was successful and the resource was created.
- 400: The request was malformed.
- 403: The request was forbidden.
- 404: The requested resource type does not exist.

#### Examples

1. Creating a resource
    ```json
    POST /user
    {
        "data": {
            "type": "user",
            "attributes": {
                "name": "Emily",
                "email": "emily@zenstack.dev"
            }
        }
    }
    ```

1. Creating a resource with relationships attached

    ```json
    POST /user
    {
        "data": {
            "type": "user",
            "attributes": {
                "name": "Emily",
                "email": "emily@zenstack.dev"
            },
            "relationships": {
                "posts": {
                    "data": [{ "type": "post", "id": 1 }]
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

### Updating a resource

A resource can be updated using the following endpoints:

```ts
PUT /:type/:id
PATCH /:type/:id
```

Both `PUT` and `PATCH` do partial update and has exactly the same behavior.

:::info
Besides plain fields, you can also include relationships in the request body. Please note that this won't update the related resource; instead if only replaces the relationships. If you update a to-many relationship, the new collection will entirely replace the old one.

Relationships can also be manipulated directly. See [Manipulating Relationships](#manipulating-relationships) for more details.
:::

#### Status codes

- 200: The request was successful and the resource was updated.
- 400: The request was malformed.
- 403: The request was forbidden.
- 404: The requested resource type or ID does not exist.

#### Examples

1. Updating a resource

    ```json
    PUT /post/1
    {
        "data": {
            "type": "post",
            "attributes": {
                "title": "My Awesome Post"
            }
        }
    }
    ```

1. Updating a resource's relationships

    ```json
    PUT /user/1
    {
        "data": {
            "type": "user",
            "relationships": {
                "posts": {
                    "data": [{ "type": "post", "id": 2 }]
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```


### Upserting a resource

JSON:API didn't specify a convention for "upsert" operations. ZenStack uses a variation of the "create" operation to represent "upsert", and uses the request meta to indicate the intention. See details in [examples](#examples-10).

```
POST /:type
```

#### Status codes

- 201: The request was successful and the resource was created.
- 200: The request was successful and the resource was updated.
- 400: The request was malformed.
- 403: The request was forbidden.
- 404: The requested resource type does not exist.

#### Examples

```json
POST /user
{
    "data": {
        "type": "user",
        "attributes": {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "Emily",
            "email": "emily@zenstack.dev"
        }
    },
    "meta": {
        "operation": "upsert",
        "matchFields": ["id"],
    }
}
```

The `meta.operation` field must be "upsert", and the `meta.matchFields` field must be an array of field names that are used to determine if the resource already exists. If an existing resource is found, "update" operation is conducted, otherwise "create". The `meta.matchFields` fields must be unique fields, and they must have corresponding entries in `data.attributes`.

### Deleting a resource

A resource can be deleted using the following endpoint:

#### Status codes

- 204: The request was successful and the resource was deleted.
- 403: The request was forbidden.
- 404: The requested resource type or ID does not exist.

```ts
DELETE /:type/:id
```

### Manipulating relationships

Relationships can be manipulated using the following endpoints:

#### Adding to a to-many relationship

```ts
POST /:type/:id/relationships/:relationship
```

##### Status codes

- 200: The request was successful and the relationship was updated.
- 403: The request was forbidden.
- 404: The requested resource type, ID, or relationship does not exist.

##### Examples

```json
POST /user/1/relationships/posts
{
    "data": [
        { "type": "post", "id": "1" },
        { "type": "post", "id": "2" }
    ]
}
```

#### Updating a relationship (to-one or to-many)

```ts
PUT /:type/:id/relationships/:relationship
PATCH /:type/:id/relationships/:relationship
```

:::info
`PUT` and `PATCH` has exactly the same behavior and both relace the existing relationships with the new ones entirely.
:::

##### Status codes

- 200: The request was successful and the relationship was updated.
- 403: The request was forbidden.
- 404: The requested resource type, ID, or relationship does not exist.

##### Examples

1. Replacing a to-many relationship

    ```json
    PUT /user/1/relationships/posts
    {
        "data": [
            { "type": "post", "id": "1" },
            { "type": "post", "id": "2" }
        ]
    }
    ```

1. Replacing a to-one relationship

    ```json
    PUT /post/1/relationships/author
    {
        "data": { "type": "user", "id": "2" }
    }
    ```

1. Clearing a to-many relationship

    ```json
    PUT /user/1/relationships/posts
    {
        "data": []
    }
    ```

1. Clearing a to-one relationship

    ```json
    PUT /post/1/relationships/author
    {
        "data": null
    }
    ```

## Compound ID Fields

Prisma allows a model to have compound ID fields, e.g.:

```zmodel
model Post {
    id1 Int
    id2 Int
    @@id([id1, id2])
}
```

The JSON:API specification doesn't have a native way to represent compound IDs. To mitigate this limitation, when returning an entity with compound IDs, ZenStack synthesizes an "id" field to carry the ID values joined with underscore:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "id": "1_2",
        "attributes": {
            "id1": 1,
            "id2": 2,
            ...
        },
        "links" : {
            "self" : "http://localhost:3100/api/model/post/1_2"
        },
        ...
    }
}
```

You can use this ID value convension in places where an ID is needed, e.g., reading a single entity.

```ts
GET /post/1_2
```

Limitations:

1. Joining ID values with underscore implies that the ID values themselves cannot contain underscores. We'll make the separator configurable in the future.
1. Prisma allows you to create a name for the compound ID field. Such usage is not yet supported by the RESTful API handler.

## Serialization

ZenStack uses [superjson](https://github.com/blitz-js/superjson) to serialize and deserialize data. Superjson generates two parts during serialization:

- json:

    The JSON-compatible serialization result.

- meta:

    The serialization metadata including information like field types that facilitates deserialization.

If the data only involves simple data types, the serialization result is the same as regular `JSON.stringify`, and no `meta` part is generated. However, for complex data types (like `Bytes`, `Decimal`, etc.), a `meta` object will be generated, which needs to be carried along when sending the request, and will also be included in the response.

When sending requests, if superjson-serializing the request body results in a `meta` object, it should be put into a ```{ "serialization": meta }``` object and included in the `meta` field of the request body. For example, if you have a `bytes` field of type `Bytes`, the request body should look like:

```json
POST /post
{
    "data": {
        "type": "post",
        "attributes": {
            ...
            "bytes": "AQID" // base64-encoded bytes
        }
    },
    "meta": { 
        "serialization": {"values": { "data.attributes.bytes": [[ "custom", "Bytes"]] } } 
    } 
}
```

Correspondingly, the response body of a query may look like:

```json
GET /post/1
{
    "data": {
        "id": "1",
        "type": "post",
        "attributes": {
            ...
            "bytes": "AQID" // base64-encoded bytes
        }
    },
    "meta": { 
        "serialization": {"values": { "data.attributes.bytes": [[ "custom", "Bytes"]] } } 
    } 
}
```

You should use the `meta.serialization` field value to superjson-deserialize the response body.

## Error Handling

An error response is an object containing the following fields:

- errors

    An array of error objects, each containing the following fields:

    - code: `string`, error code
    - status: `number`, HTTP status code
    - title: `string`, error title
    - detail: `string`, error detail
    - prismaCode: `string`, Prisma error code, if the error is thrown by Prisma

### Example

```json
{
   "errors" : [
      {
         "code" : "unsupported-model",
         "detail" : "Model foo doesn't exist",
         "status" : 404,
         "title" : "Unsupported model type"
      }
   ]
}
```
