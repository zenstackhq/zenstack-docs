# API Handlers

ZenStack supports two API styles: ***rpc*** and ***rest***:

- ***rpc*** style API directly mirrors Prisma client's API, thus provides endpoints like `[model]/findMany`, `[model]/create`, etc. Its input and output data format also aligns with that of Prisma client.

- ***rest*** style API is designed to be more RESTful, thus provides endpoints like `[model]`, `[model]/[id]`, `[model]/[id]/relationships/[relationship]`, etc. It uses [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/) as its data format.

API handlers are framework-agnostic and deals with canonicalized request and response objects. It's the responsibility of the server adapters to translate the framework-specific request and response types. You can use either of these two API handlers with any server adapter.

The following diagram illustrates their relationships with server adapters.
