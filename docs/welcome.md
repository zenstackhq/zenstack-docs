# Welcome to ZenStack

Hey 👋, I'm glad you found us here.

If you are using TypeScript to build database-centric API or web apps, you are in the right place. ZenStack is an open-source toolkit built above [Prisma](https://prisma.io) - the most popular ORM for Node.js. ZenStack pushes Prisma's power to a new level and boosts the development efficiency of every layer of your stack - from access control, to API development, and all the way up to the frontend.

Some of the most common use cases of ZenStack include:
- Multi-tenant SaaS
- Applications with complex access control requirements
- CRUD-intensive API or web apps

## Features

- ORM with built-in access control and data validation

- Auto-generated CRUD API - RESTful & tRPC

- Auto-generated OpenAPI documentation

- Auto-generated frontend data query hooks - SWR & TanStack Query

- Integrations with popular authentication services and full-stack/backend frameworks

- A plugin system for great extensibility

## Find the Learning Path That Fits You

ZenStack is a comprehensive toolkit that touches a wide range of topics. For most developers, we'd highly recommend you start with the [The Complete Guide](/docs/the-complete-guide) to build a solid understanding of each layer of ZenStack's functionalities. The guide is designed to lay out concepts gradually and lead you through the learning journey from using ZenStack just as a better ORM, to leveraging its total power in full-stack development. The guide is pretty long, but trust me you'll enjoy the reading 😉.

If you're the kind of inpatient developer who wants to get your hand dirty ASAP, you can also jump straight to the [Quick Start](/docs/category/quick-start) guide. It shows how to quickly set up a ZenStack project targeting the framework of your choice.
