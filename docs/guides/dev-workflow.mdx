# Development Workflow

The development workflow using ZenStack is very close to Prisma. The main difference is,
instead of modifying `schema.prisma` file, you edit `schema.zmodel` to make changes to
data models and policies and then use `zenstack generate` command to generate Prisma
schema. After that, everything is just standard Prisma workflow, including generating
and deploying migrations.

The following diagram illustrates a typical workflow for prototyping data model changes
during feature development:

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';
import ThemedImage from '@theme/ThemedImage';

<ThemedImage
    alt="Feature Prototyping Workflow"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/dev-workflow-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/dev-workflow-dark.png'),
    }}
/>
