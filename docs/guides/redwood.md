# Using With RedwoodJS

[RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com/) is an opinionated full-stack framework that combines a set of tools and libraries and helps you build GraphQL-based applications quickly without struggling with tooling.

ZenStack provides a plugin package to help you easily integrate with RedwoodJS projects. After setting it up, you can define access policies in ZModel and use the enhanced `PrismaClient` to enforce the policies in your services automatically.

## Details

### Setting up

You can prepare your RedwoodJS project for ZenStack by running the following command at the root of your project:

```bash
yarn rw setup package @zenstackhq/redwood
```

The setup command will:

1. Update "redwood.toml" to allow the ZenStack CLI plugin
   
    ```yaml
    [[experimental.cli.plugins]]
    package = "@zenstackhq/redwood"
    enabled = true
    ```

2. Install ZenStack dependencies to the "api" package
   
    - `zenstack`: the main CLI
    - `@zenstackhq/runtime`: the runtime library for creating enhanced `PrismaClient`
    - `@zenstackhq/redwood`: custom CLI and runtime for RedwoodJS

3. Prepare ZModel schema

    Your Prisma schema file "api/db/schema.prisma" will be copied to "api/db/schema.zmodel". Moving forward, you should edit "schema.zmodel" to update the database schema and access policies. The "schema.prisma" file will be regenerated when you run `yarn rw @zenstackhq generate`.

4. Register the location of "schema.zmodel" and "schema.prisma" in "api/package.json"

    ```json title="api/package.json"
    {
      ...
      "zenstack": {
        "schema": "db/schema.zmodel",
        "prisma": "db/schema.prisma"
      }
    }
    ```
   
5. Install a GraphQLYoga plugin to the GraphQL handler
   
    ```ts title="api/src/functions/graphql.[ts|js]"
    import { useZenStack } from '@zenstackhq/redwood'
    import { db } from 'src/lib/db'
    import { createGraphQLHandler } from '@redwoodjs/graphql-server'
    ...

    export const handler = createGraphQLHandler({
      ...
      extraPlugins: [useZenStack(db)],
    })
    ```

    The `useZenStack` plugin creates an enhanced `PrismaClient` for the current requesting user and stores it as `db` field in the global GraphQL context. You can use it in your service code via `context.db`. For example, the service for listing blog posts can be implemented as follows: only posts readable to the current user will be returned.

    ```ts title="api/src/services/posts/posts.js"
    export const posts = (...args) => {
      return context.db.post.findMany()
    }
    ```

    The plugin, by default, uses `context.currentUser` to get the current requesting user. You can customize it by passing in a function as the second argument to calculate a custom user object based on `context.currentUser`. E.g.:

    ```ts
    useZenStack(db, async (currentUser) => {
      const typedUser = currentUser as { id: string };
      const dbUser = await db.user.findUnique({ 
        where: { id: typedUser.id },
        // select more fields
        select: { id: true, role: true }
      });
      return dbUser;
    });
    ```

    See [here](/docs/the-complete-guide/part1/access-policy/current-user) for more details about accessing the current user.
   
6. Eject service templates

    The setup runs `yarn rw setup generator service` to eject template files used by `yarn rw g service` command. It also modifies the templates to use `context.db` instead of `db` to access the database with automatic access policy enforcement.

### Modeling data and access policies

ZenStack's ZModel language is a superset of Prisma schema language. You should use it to define both the data schema and access policies. [The Complete Guide](/docs/the-complete-guide/part1/) of ZenStack is the best way to learn how to author ZModel schemas. Here's a quick example to show how you can define access policies for the blog post sample used throughout the official RedwoodJS tutorial:

```zmodel title="api/db/schema.zmodel"
model Post {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  body      String
  comments  Comment[]
  user      User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId    Int
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  published Boolean @default(true)

  // üîê Admin user can do everything to his own posts
  @@allow('all', auth().roles == 'admin' && auth() == user)

  // üîê Posts are visible to everyone if published
  @@allow('read', published)
}
```

You should run the following command after updating "schema.zmodel":

```bash
yarn rw @zenstackhq generate
```

The command does the following things:

1. Regenerate "schema.prisma"
2. Run `prisma generate` to regenerate `PrismaClient`
3. Generate supporting JS modules for enforcing access policies at runtime


<!-- You can also use the

```bash
yarn rw @zenstackhq sample
```

command to browse a list of sample schemas and create from them. -->

### Development workflow

The workflow of using ZenStack is very similar to using Prisma in RedwoodJS projects. The two main differences are:

1. Code generation

    You should run `yarn rw @zenstackhq generate` instead of `yarn rw prisma generate`. The ZenStack's "generate" command internally regenerates the Prisma schema from the ZModel schema, runs `prisma generate` automatically, and outputs supporting modules for access policy enforcement.

2. Database access in services

    In your service code, you should use `context.db` instead of `db` for accessing the database. The setup procedure prepared a customized service code template. When you run `yarn rw g service`, the generated code will already use `context.db`.

Other Prisma-related workflows like generation migration or pushing schema to the database stay unchanged.

### Deployment

You should run the "generate" command in your deployment script before `yarn rw deploy`. For example, to deploy to Vercel, the command can be:

```bash
yarn rw @zenstackhq generate && yarn rw deploy vercel
```

### Using the `@zenstackhq` CLI plugin

The `@zenstackhq/redwood` package registers a set of custom commands to the RedwoodJS CLI under the `@zenstackhq` namespace. You can run it with:

```bash
yarn rw @zenstackhq <cmd> [options] 
```

The plugin is a simple wrapper of the standard `zenstack` CLI, similar to how RedwoodJS wraps the standard `prisma` CLI. It's equivalent to running `npx zenstack ...` inside the "api" directory.

See the [CLI references](/docs/reference/cli) for the complete list of commands.
