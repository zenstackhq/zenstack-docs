# Using With tRPC

[tRPC](https://trpc.io) is a fantastic library that magically turns server-side procedures into client-callable functions without requiring you to provide any formal contract. The popular [T3 stack](https://create.t3.gg/) promotes the combo of Prisma + tRPC for achieving type safety from your frontend all the way down to the database.

ZenStack makes things even easier by automatically generating tRPC routers from the ZModel schema. You can use the generated routers together with an enhanced Prisma client; since the Prisma client has the ability to enforce access policies, there is no need to implement authorization code anymore.

## Details

### 1. Initializing the project

If you haven't initialized your tRPC project with ZenStack, run the following command to do it:

```bash
npx zenstack@latest init
```

<InitTips />

### 2. Installing the tRPC plugin

You can enable tRPC router generation with the `@zenstackhq/trpc` plugin.

First install the trpc package:

```bash
npm install -D @zenstackhq/trpc@latest
```

Then, add the following plugin configuration to your ZModel schema. Note that the configuration is different for tRPC v10 and v11:

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="v10" label={`tRPC v10`}>

```zmodel title='/schema.zmodel'
plugin trpc {
    provider = '@zenstackhq/trpc'
    output = 'src/server/routers/generated'
}
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="v11" label={`tRPC v11 (preview)`}>

To use with tRPC v11, you need to explicitly set the "version" option to "v11" and add two extra options to let ZenStack know where to import the tRPC's router factory (named `createTRPCRouter`) and procedure factory (named `procedure`) from. For example, with the following settings:

```zmodel title='/schema.zmodel'
plugin trpc {
    provider = '@zenstackhq/trpc'
    output = 'src/server/routers/generated'
    version = 'v11'
    importCreateRouter = "../../trpc"
    importProcedure = "../../trpc"
}
```

The generated tRPC routers will contain code like the following:

```ts
import { createTRPCRouter } from "../../trpc";
import { procedure } from "../../trpc";

export default function createRouter() {
  return createTRPCRouter({
    findMany: procedure.input(...).query(...) => ...
    ...
  });
}

```

:::info Why is v11 more complicated?

tRPC v11 removed several public TypeScript types that our previous way of code generation relied on. To get around this, we have to resort to letting the user tell us where to import the factories from so we can use them without explicitly typing them.

### 3. Setting up the tRPC context

Usually in your tRPC project, you have a function to create a tRPC context. You need to make sure the context contains a `prisma` field that is an instance of Prisma client. The generated tRPC routers use that to talk to the database.

For most of the cases you should use a Prisma client that's "enhanced" by ZenStack so that the CRUD operations are guarded by the access policies defined in the ZModel schema. Here's a quick example with Next.js:

```ts title='/src/server/context.ts'

import { enhance } from '@zenstackhq/runtime';
import { prisma } from './db';
import { getSessionUser } from './auth';

export const createContext = async ({ req, res }: CreateNextContextOptions) => {
    return {
        ...,
        // use access-control-enabled Prisma client
        prisma: await enhance(prisma, { user: getSessionUser(req, res) }),
    };
};
```

### 4. Using the generated routers

Now run the `zenstack` CLI to generate artifacts:

```bash
npx zenstack generate
```

You should find a bunch of tRPC routers generated in the output folder, one per each data model. A `createRouter` helper function is also generated, which returns a router instance for all models. You can use it as your top-level tRPC router, or merge it with other routers to form a more complex setup.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="v10" label={`tRPC v10`}>

```ts title='/src/server/routers/_app.ts'
import { createRouter } from './generated/routers';

const t = initTRPC.context<Context>().create();

export const appRouter = createRouter(t.router, t.procedure);
export type AppRouter = typeof appRouter;
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="v11" label={`tRPC v11`}>

```ts title='/src/server/routers/_app.ts'
import { createRouter } from './generated/routers';

const t = initTRPC.context<Context>().create();

export const procedure = t.publicProcedure;
export const createTRPCRouter = t.createRouter;

...

export const appRouter = createRouter();
export type AppRouter = typeof appRouter;
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

_NOTE_: The ZenStack trpc plugin is based on the awesome work by [Omar Dulaimi](https://github.com/omar-dulaimi/prisma-trpc-generator).
