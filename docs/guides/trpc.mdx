# Using With tRPC

[tRPC](https://trpc.io) is a fantastic library that magically turns server-side procedures into client-callable functions without requiring you to provide any formal contract. The popular [T3 stack](https://create.t3.gg/) promotes the combo of Prisma + tRPC for achieving type safety from your frontend all the way down to the database.

ZenStack makes things even easier by automatically generating tRPC routers from the ZModel schema. You can use the generated routers together with an enhanced Prisma client; since the Prisma client has the ability to enforce access policies, there is no need to implement authorization code anymore.

## Details

### 1. Initializing the project

If you haven't initialized your tRPC project with ZenStack, run the following command to do it:

```bash
npx zenstack@latest init
```

### 2. Installing the tRPC plugin

You can enable tRPC router generation with the `@zenstackhq/trpc` plugin.

First install the trpc package:

```bash
npm install -D @zenstackhq/trpc@latest
```

```zmodel title='/schema.zmodel'

plugin trpc {
    provider = '@zenstackhq/trpc'
    output = 'src/server/routers/generated'
}

```

### 3. Setting up the tRPC context

Usually in your tRPC project, you have a function to create a tRPC context. You need to make sure the context contains a `prisma` field that is an instance of Prisma client. The generated tRPC routers use that to talk to the database.

For most of the cases you should use a Prisma client that's "enhanced" by ZenStack so that the CRUD operations are guarded by the access policies defined in the ZModel schema. Here's a quick example with Next.js:

```ts title='/src/server/context.ts'

import { withPresets } from '@zenstackhq/runtime';
import { prisma } from './db';
import { getSessionUser } from './auth';

export const createContext = async ({ req, res }: CreateNextContextOptions) => {
    return {
        ...,
        // use access-control-enabled Prisma client
        prisma: await withPresets(prisma, { user: getSessionUser(req, res) }),
    };
};
```

### 4. Using the generated routers

Now run the `zenstack` CLI to generate artifacts:

```bash
npx zenstack generate
```

You should find a bunch of tRPC routers generated in the output folder, one per each data model. A `createRouter` helper function is also generated, which returns a router instance for all models. You can use it as your top-level tRPC router, or merge it with other routers to form a more complex setup.

```ts title='/src/server/routers/_app.ts'
import { createRouter } from './generated/routers';

const t = initTRPC.context<Context>().create();

export const appRouter = createRouter(t.router, t.procedure);

export type AppRouter = typeof appRouter;
```

:::info
The generated tRPC routers use [`zod`](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) for input validation. Howerver, zod had [a regression](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod/issues/2184) in version higher than "v3.21.1", causing the generated code fail to compile. Please make sure you use zod version <= "v3.21.1".

_NOTE_: The ZenStack trpc plugin is based on the awesome work by [Omar Dulaimi](https://github.com/omar-dulaimi/prisma-trpc-generator).
