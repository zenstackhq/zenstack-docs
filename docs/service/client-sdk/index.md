# Client SDK

You can consume the query services by writing HTTP calls directly, but it's time consuming and error prone. Just as with deriving the CRUD service from the data model, we can derive client SDKs automatically, too.

Today, ZenStack provides an [TanStack Query](./tanstack-query) integration that gives you a fully typed and feature-rich query client. Other types of client will be added in the future.
