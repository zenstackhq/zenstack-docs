# Introduction

ZenStack is built as an extension to the fantastic ORM toolkit - [Prisma](https://prisma.io). The goal is to unleash its full potential for full-stack web app development. ZenStack enhances Prisma by adding the following goodies:

üõ†Ô∏è A superset of Prisma's schema language that supports custom attributes and functions.

‚õΩÔ∏è Built-in support for access policies and data validation rules.

üöÄ Auto-generated APIs for accessing database from the frontend without building an intermediary backend.

üß© An extensible plugin system for code generation with greater flexibility.

ZenStack is not opinionated toward any stack or framework. It's a toolkit, not another framework. It's meant to work well with most Javascript full-stack frameworks, like Next.js, Nuxt.js, Remix.run, SvelteKit, etc.

The following diagram gives a high-level overview of how it works.

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';
import ThemedImage from '@theme/ThemedImage';

<a href={useBaseUrl('/img/architecture-light.png')} target="_blank">
    <ThemedImage
        alt="ZenStack Architecture"
        sources={{
            light: useBaseUrl('/img/architecture-light.png'),
            dark: useBaseUrl('/img/architecture-dark.png'),
        }}
    />
</a>

Don't worry if you don't fully get it right away. In the following few sections, we'll guide you through
creating a simple web app - with the framework you love.
