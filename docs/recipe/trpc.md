# Using ZenStack With tRPC

In previous versions of ZenStack, [tRPC](https://trpc.io) integration was provided as a built-in package. For v3, it is now maintained by the community at [`zenstack-trpc`](https://github.com/olup/zenstack-trpc). This shift allows the core team to focus development resources on the essential components while the community contributes specialized integrations. Please check its GitHub repo for documentation.

Special thanks to [Olup](https://github.com/olup) for building and maintaining this amazing implementation!
