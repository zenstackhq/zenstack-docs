# üôãüèª FAQ

### Is ZenStack implemented with Postgres RLS (row-level-security)?

No, it is not implemented with Postgres RLS. Instead, ZenStack applies access control rules by injecting into Prisma's query arguments and (in certain scenarios) conducting post-query filtering. The choice brings several benefits:

1. Database agnostic: ZenStack works with any database that Prisma supports.
1. No need to create migrations when changing access control rules.
1. A significantly simpler syntax for access control rules compared to SQL RLS.
1. Colocating access control rules with the data model.

### Is ZenStack framework-agnostic?

Yes, ZenStack is framework-agnostic. The core of ZenStack's runtime is a transparent proxy wrapping a PrismaClient, so it can be used in any framework that can run Prisma. ZenStack already provides adapters for popular frameworks like [Next.js](/docs/reference/server-adapters/next) and [Fastify](/docs/reference/server-adapters/fastify), and more are being made. It's also easy to write your own adapters.

### How to use ZenStack in a monorepo setup?

To use ZenStack in a monorepo setup (e.g., pnpm workspace), run `zenstack init` in the package where `schema.prisma` resides (usually also where the global `prisma` instance is exported). There's no need to install ZenStack-related packages at the workspace level.

### Is ZModel fully compatible with Prisma Schema?

The ZModel language is designed to be a superset of Prisma Schema. The major extension that ZModel made to Prisma schema today are:

-   [Custom attributes](/docs/reference/zmodel-language#custom-attributes-and-functions)
-   [Plugins](/docs/category/plugins)

Using a separate DSL gives us the flexibility to add more extensions in the future; however, the goal is to maintain the "superset" positioning, i.e., every valid `schema.prisma` is a valid `schema.zmodel`.

In practice, you may run into problems that the `schema.prisma` generated by ZenStack triggers validation errors in `prisma` CLI. This is because Prisma CLI has many validation rules, some quite subtle. We try to replicate those rules in `zenstack` CLI, but it's more of a best-effort approach. Fortunately, the errors reported by `prisma` CLI usually give pretty good hints on what to change in `schema.zmodel`.

We will continue improving the parity between ZModel and Prisma Schema regarding validation rules.
